ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tanya Everitt

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am in my last semester studying accounting, commercial law, and computer science. Even though my page lacks projects (mainly due to not saving my university projects that are now unfortunately are deleted), it is never too late to starts this GitHub expedition.

Please join me on my journey to building all sorts of project ideas and documentating my learnings.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the difference in Angular vs React(flat food app), Python(computer vision), and always new things on Javascript.

ğŸ“« Reach me on my Linkedin -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-everitt/
